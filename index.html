                        <p class="lead">Polyswing produces a series of complex swing rhythms that vary in tempo and subdivision.</p>
                        <p>Swing rhythms are most often associated with triplet subdivisions. The first note is given a duration of two triplets, and the second is given a duration of one triplet. A recent rhythmic trend, amongst contemporary Jazz artists especially, is to extend the concept of swing to larger subdivisions. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTZdyQ93Nq8" target="_blank">Shawn Crowder does a fantastic job explaining <em>quintuplet swing</em> in this video</a>. Ultimately, any subdivision can be swung. The math is easier to intuit using subdivisions of odd numbers, because they can be reduced down to two unequal halves; one larger and one shorter. For example, in a quintuplet swing, the <em>larger</em> half would get a duration of three tuplets, and the <em>smaller</em> half would get a duration of two tuplets. Even subdivisions can swing, too; however this involves decimal math, which is not impossible, but it is less intuitive rhythmically. As subdivisions become larger, the swing begins to sound closer to being <em>even</em>. For example, in the case of a 21-tuplet, where one half would get a duration of 11 tuplets, and another would get a duration of 10 tuplets, the rhythm at most practical tempi is indistiguishable from a series of evenly subdivided note values.</p>
                        <p>To perform the piece, play with the black bar, which is called the <em>swing timer</em> collides with one of the edges. The red line near each of the edges is a visual aid to help you gauge how far the <em>swing timer</em> is from the edge. Information regarding the tempo, subdivision, and the ratio of the swing pattern is displayed below the iterations counter. After pressing start, the iteration counter will count down from 5. The piece will begin immediately after, so be ready. The transition from groove to groove can be drastic due to the fact that the tempo can range from 60 BPM to 84 BPM. Do not worry about not nailing the groove on the first iteration. The shakiness adds to the texture!</p>
